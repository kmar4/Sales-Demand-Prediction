# Sales-Demand-Prediction
## Overview
This project aims to forecast the demand for fishing and camping materials using advanced deep learning techniques. Accurate predictions help suppliers and retailers manage inventory, optimize supply chains, and meet customer demands efficiently, especially during peak seasons.
## Key Features
+ Detailed analysis of historical sales data for fishing and camping equipment.
+ Implementation of recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures, including LSTM and GRU, tailored to time series data.
+ Comparison of deep learning models to determine the most effective approach for demand forecasting.
## Techniques Used
Data Preprocessing:
+ Handling missing data and outliers.
+ Normalization of sales figures to ensure consistency.
+ Creation of time series features such as lag values and rolling averages.
Feature Engineering: + Inclusion of seasonality indicators (e.g., summer, holiday season) to capture demand spikes.
## Deep Learning Models:
+ RNN (Recurrent Neural Network): For capturing sequential dependencies in the data.
+ LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): For modeling long-term dependencies and addressing vanishing gradients.
+ GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit): For a computationally efficient alternative to LSTM.
